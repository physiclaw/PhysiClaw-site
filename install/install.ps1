# PhysiClaw installer (Windows 11).
#
# Usage (recommended - runs in a child shell so the installer can't crash yours):
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "iwr -useb https://physiclaw.ai/install.ps1 | iex"
#
# Also works, but if the install fails the calling shell may exit:
#   iwr -useb https://physiclaw.ai/install.ps1 | iex
#
# Optional (set before invoking):
#   $env:PHYSICLAW_VERSION = '0.0.5'   # pin a version
#   $env:PHYSICLAW_DRY_RUN = '1'       # same as -DryRun
#   $env:NO_COLOR = '1'                # plain output
#
# To pass options through ``iwr | iex``, wrap the script in a scriptblock.
# Use .Content here - iwr returns a response object, not a string:
#   & ([scriptblock]::Create((iwr -useb https://physiclaw.ai/install.ps1).Content)) -Version 0.0.5 -DryRun
#
# What it does (hardware setup is still a separate step at the end):
#   1. Checks you're on Windows.
#   2. Installs `uv` if missing (via astral.sh installer, run in a child shell
#      so its `exit 1` on failure never reaches your session).
#   3. Ensures Python 3.12 is available (no-op if already cached).
#   4. Installs `physiclaw` (small - no heavy ML deps in the package).
#   5. Runs `physiclaw setup local-vision-model` to install the icon-detector
#      model. By default it fetches a prebuilt ONNX (fast, no extra deps); if
#      that's unreachable it falls back to downloading the upstream PyTorch
#      weights and converting them in an ephemeral `uv run --with` env.
#      Idempotent; no-ops if the ONNX is already cached.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - PowerShell 5.1+ (ships with Windows 11) or PowerShell 7+.
#   - Execution policy must allow scripts. If you see a policy warning:
#       Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
